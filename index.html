<h4 style="color:#0a374c"> June 25: Something Cool and Programming Reflections </h4>
<hr style="height:1px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p><i>Interactive Installations</i></p>
<p>My "something cool" is a creative studio that Alec informed me of last semester called Design I/O, specializing in immersive installations for exhibitions and public spaces. Design I/O's <a href="http://design-io.com/">website</a> showcases their stunning interactive art pieces, including two that I am particulary fond of: <a href="http://design-io.com/projects/ConnectedWorlds/">Connected Worlds</a> and <a href="http://design-io.com/projects/WeatherWorlds/">Weather Worlds</a>. </p>

<p>According to Design/IO, "Connected World's is a large scale immersive, interactive ecosystem developed for the New York Hall of Science. The installation is composed of six interactive ecosystems spread out across the walls of the Great Hall, connected together by a 3000 sqft interactive floor and a 45ft high waterfall. Children can use physical logs to divert water flowing across the floor from the waterfall into the different environments, where they can then use their hands to plant seeds. As the different environments bloom, creatures appear based on the health of the environment and the type of plants growing in it." Weather Worlds is "an interactive installation that grants children weather controlling superpowers...Using their bodies children can conjure a storm, release a twisting tornado or rain down bolts of lightning from their fingertips." </p>

<p>Both installations remind me of an exhibition housed at the Museum of Science when I was growing up in the 90s. Visitors would stand in front of a wall and see colorful projections of their silouttes. There was also a camera-like feature where the silouettes would appear frozen at intervals. It was so cool! I think it's amazing how programming and physical computing have evolved to produce such striking and impactful art! </p>

<p><i>General Reflections</i></p>
<p>Although sometimes difficult, I truly appreciate the problem-solving, project-based nature of this course. In creating Eric's people card I ran into a host of challenges trying to layer images atop one another. I've found that programming in small increments works better for me than attempting to spend several hours straight working on a project. It's'helpful to see a challenge with a fresh pair of eyes.  </p>

<h4 style="color:#0a374c"> June 22: People Card Mock Ups</h4>
<p><i>Eric's People Card</i></p>
<p>It is the second day of class and I'm excited to be working on Eric's people card.  I came up with four mock ups based on his interest in scuba diving as well as his love of steak, video games, and his pet beagle. I'm getting used to using Github Desktop, Sublime Text, and Slack, and looking forward to increasing my familiarity with these tools.</p>
