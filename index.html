<h4 style="color:#0a374c"> July 13: New Idea for Moving Things in Relation to Other Things</h4>
<hr style="height:1px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p><i>CSS Grid Layout</i></p>
<p><b>What did you accomplish today?</b></p> 

<p>Today, I workshopped my project ideas with two of my classmates who offered valuble feedback on the look and feel of my mermaid map. They were split on whether or not to include music that autoplays on the map page.</p>

<p>I spoke with Shaunalynn about using CSS grid layouts to make the mermaids on the map responsive and I'm currently reading <a href=https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-grid-layout/>this tutorial.</a> I think accomplishing this will be the trickiest part of my project and I think I'll feel really once I figure it out.</p>

<p><b>What are your goals for the next session?</b></p>

<p>By the next session, I hope that my map is interactive and linking to the individual mermaid pages. From there, I hope to build out the other pages and make small JS or video animations to accompany them.</p>

<p><b> What can the teaching team do to help?</b></p> 

<p>I'm going to the Sprouts space tomorrow night and could use some pointers for implementing the CSS layout.</p>

<h4 style="color:#0a374c"> July 12: Trouble Moving Things in Relation to Other Things</h4>
<hr style="height:1px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p><i>Some Progress</i></p>
<p><b>What did you accomplish today?</b></p> 

<p>I worked on putting together the map and positioning the mermaids. I had some mixed results. I wasn't able to turn the mermaids into links-- maybe because they're background images? I was also unable to add multiple mermaids, though I was successful in positioning one in a specific position on the map. I would like the map to take up the entire page without repeating or stretching, maybe by constraining the dimensions of the window-- if that is possible?</p>

<p>I'm wondering whether I should use Dreamweaver to create dynamic links on the map. This was Selim's suggestion (classmate).</p>

<p> I also tried building out secondary pages, but I'm having trouble lining up the header with the white text box-- essentially the same challenge I'm having with positioning icons on the map: <a href=https://maisie28.github.io/australia.html>Australia page.</a></p>

<p>Also, I fixed the images on my journal, so they should be visible via the public slack link. </p>

<p>Also, I played around with the Yawk Yawk image in CodePen, but don't have anything worth sharing yet.  I'm happy to be getting the hand of DIVs, IDs, and Classes. </p>

<p><b>What are your goals for the next session?</b></p>

<p> My goal for next session is to come up with a plan for getting the mermaids onto the map, and for them to link to region-specific pages. This is my big to-do this week.</p>

<p><b> What can the teaching team do to help?</b></p> 

<p>I could use some help deciding whether to stick with HTML/CSS/JS for the map or to try using Dreamweaver or another program to get the mermaids to function as dynamic links.  Thank you!!!</p>

<p><i>Yawk Yawk Changes Color!</i></p>
<p><b>What did you accomplish today?</b> With lots of help from Elise, Selim, Molly, and Shaunalynn, I now have a Yawk Yawk that is changing color-- wow!  The link is available here: <a href=https://maisie28.github.io/tryingagain.html>Colorful Yawk Yawk</a></p>
<p>Also, I learned that the pictures I was uploading to my journal are not visible to others because I was missing a step in uploading them via slack-- eek! </p>
<p><b>What are your goals for the next session?</b> My goal for today is to fix the problem with the pictures and continue working on the Yawk Yawk. In addition, I hope to take a look at the tool Molly sent me to place the mermaids on the map as they correspond to different regions.</p>
<p><b> What can the teaching team do to help?</b> I am planning to attend the session on Thursday and will likely need some help with JS animation and aligning mermaids on the map.  Also, I am hoping to figure out how to make the mermaids glow when the user hovers over them, and to make a dialogue box pop up identifying the region.</p>

<hr style="height:1px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p><i>Mermaid Pages Mock Up</i></p>
<p>I completed a mock up that could be used for the mermaid pages. The background image might repeat as the length of the pages will vary. (I think it's abstract enough that this could work.)  I took a photo of coral and ran it through a filter in Photoshop.  The Yawk Yawk image will (hopefully) be replaced by a JS animation or video.</p>

<h4 style="color:#0a374c"> July 8: Final-Final Map Design</h4>
<hr style="height:1px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p><i>New Font, New Mock-Up/Functionality</i></p>
<p>I've finally settled on a design and determined where the mermaids will be located. I swapped out the font and added a background shadow to the map, which gives it some depth. Ideally, when the user hovers over each mermaid, they will glow and a box listing the name of the region will appear.  When the user clicks on the mermaid s/he will be brought to a page listing the mermaids native to that region.</p>

<p><i>Progress and Planning</i></p>
<p><b>What did you accomplish today?</b> </p>
<p>Today, I worked with Molly to turn the map into a HTML file and get the mermaids to display on the page.</p>
<p><b>What do you aim to have done by next session?</b> </p>
<p>My goals for the weekend are to: (1) finalize the mermaid text, (2) divide the mermaids up by region, (3) determine how they will display on the map, (4) settle on a final map mock up, (5) watch JS tutorial, and (6) mock up one secondary, specific mermaid page.</p>
<p><b>What can we (the teaching team) do to help? </b> </p>
<p>Molly is helping me by writing a piece of JS that will make it easier to place the mermaids on the map in a responsive way.

<p><i>Jellyfish</i></p>
<p>I was having lots of trouble getting the wave background to fit the screen resolution of 1920 x 1080, so I decided on a slight jelly fish theme.  I'm not sure if I like it.  I hated it last night, but I am coming around.  The border for each mermaid page might be a coral theme.  I haven't mocked it up yet.  Inside each mermaid page will be either a picture, JS animation, or a video representing the mermaid along with some text describing the lore surrounding them.</p>
<p>One challenge I hadn't considered is that many regions are home to several mermaids.  This may make the map appear cluttered with too many icons.  One way to resolve this would be to group mermaids of different regions together somehow on the page.  I'm not sure how much more complicated this would make the code.</p>

<hr style="height:1px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p><i>Mermaid of Zennor</i></p>
<p>According to Cornish folklore, a strange and beautiful woman fell in in love with a man named Matthew Trewella after hearing him sing.  After church one Sunday, Matthew followed her to an area marked by steep cliffs overlooking the sea and the pair was never heard from again.  According to the legend, Matthew went to live with her under the sea.  (Mermaids: the Myths, Legends, and Lore by Syke Alexander, pg. 100)</p>

<p><i>Lake Goddess Aine</i></p>
<p>Ireland's Lake Goddess Aine is reputed to live at bottom of Ireland's Lough Gur.  She was captured by the Earle of Desmond who stole her magic cloak and fathered her child.  After the child was born, the Earle set Aine free and she returned to the lake.  Years later, her son joined her in the lake. (Mermaids: the Myths, Legends, and Lore by Syke Alexander, pg. 103)

<p><i>Blue Men of the Muir</i></p>
<p>Dangerous blue-grey water spirits native to Scoltand, the Blue Men of the Muir were know to approach sailors and ask them a question.  If the sailors answered incorrectly, the blue men would sink their ship and drag them overboard.  The Blue Men were also rumored to cause high tides and dangerous stormy seas.

<p><i>Mermaid of Derbyshire</i></p>
<p>The presence of a malevolent mermaid dwelling in a pool below Kinder Downfall in Derbyshire, England has sparked an unusual tradition.  On Easter's Eve, townsfolk gather at the stroke of midnight to gaze into what is known as "Mermaid's Pool."  They see either their future or are sucked under water by the mermaid.

<hr style="height:1px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p><i>Neptune and Amphrite</i></p>
<p>Though there is little mention of mermaids in Greek and Roman culture, there are many water spirits and water deities, which may have served as the inspiration for mermaids. Water nymphs were sweetly seductive, nubile creatues dwelling in both fresh water (known as naiids) and oceans (known as oceanids). In Greek mythology, the powerful serpent-like river god Oceanus was able to circle the earth with his massive body and his wife, Tethys, created the world's 3,000 rivers.  Triton is the best known of the Greco-Roman water gods.  He was the son of Poseidon (Neptune to the Romans) and Amphrite, and the family lived together in a palace under the ocean.  Triton is often pictured with a fish tail and blowing a conch shell.  His music was said to control the sea. In addition, the Greek's Aphrodite and the Roman's Venus have acquatic qualities in common with Atargatis, the first mermaid. (Mermaids: the Myths, Legends, and Lore by Syke Alexander, pg. 83-87)</p>

<p><i>Selkie</i></p>
<p>Appearing in Scottish, Irish, and English lore, selkies are mysterious creatures who don seal skins that enable them to live freely on land and sea.  When they're ready to come ashore, selkies remove their seal skins and transform into human beings with no visible aquatic characteristics.  Know to be both male and female, selkie women are especially beautiful with enchanting singing voices.  Selkies can live on land for long periods of time and form close relationships with humans.  Some even start families, though they often yearn to return to their true home, the sea.  Unlike other types of mermaids, selkies are generally benevolent towards humans, and fishermen consider selkie sightings to be good luck. (Mermaids: the Myths, Legends, and Lore by Syke Alexander, pg. 94-96)

<p><i>Merrow</i></p>
<p>Known in Ireland as The Merrow, these menfolk are benevolent and gentle creatures with human torsos and fish-like lower bodies.  They can be both male and female and are known for their enchanting singing voices, webbed fingers, and cohuleen druiths- magical red hats that allows them to live underwater. (Mermaids: the Myths, Legends, and Lore by Syke Alexander, pg. 97)</p>

<p><i>Atargatis</i></p>
<p>Known as the world's first mermaid, Atargatis was a powerful deity worshipped by the ancient Assyrians.  She was associated with the moon, fertility, and life-giving water.  </p>

<p>"Mythology connects both the moon and water with the dark, mysterious, and ever-changing nature of women. Early people both revered and feared their female deities.  These qualities, which people throughout the ages have associated with mermaids, may have originated with Atargatis." (Mermaids: the Myths, Legends, and Lore by Syke Alexander, pg. 78)</p>

<p><i>Enki</i></p>
<p>Revered by residents of ancient Sumer (present day Iraq), Nammu was the sea goddess who birthed humankind.  Sumerians also worshiped her son Enki, lord of water and wisdom.  Enki is often pictured with water flowing from his shoulders and has ties to serpent deities found in other cultures. (Mermaids: the Myths, Legends, and Lore by Syke Alexander, pg. 81)

<p><i>Ea</i></p>
<p>According to the ancient Babylonians, all of the earth floated atop fresh water and was ruled by Ea.  Considered to be the earliest depiction of a merman, Ea was often represented with a human torso and the tail of a fish, though he was also depicted with fish scales and as a hybrid of a man and bird.  In addition to holding dominion over the sea, Ea was the Babylonian's god of wisdom, art, and farming. (Mermaids: the Myths, Legends, and Lore by Syke Alexander, pg. 80)

<h4 style="color:#0a374c"> June 30: Why Mermaids?</h4>
<hr style="height:1px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p><i>Modern vs. Ancient Mermaids</i></p>
<p>As a child, my favorite Disney character was the Little Mermaid-- hands down. With her bright red hair, green mermaid tail, and conflicting desire to occupy both the land and sea, I couldn't image a more compelling costume or backstory. I grew up visiting my grandparents who lived in Cape Cod, and I image my strong affinity for the Little Mermaid and the ocean began there. I loved swimming, searching for shells, and making sandcastles.  As an adult, I feel a sense of calm when I visit the ocean and I think that my fondness for mermaids lies in nostalgia for my childhood summers spent at the beach.</p>  
<p>It's interesting to me that ancient mermaids were associated with danger, vanity, and uncertainty. Across the ancient world, they were depicted as beautiful, but fearsome, likely to drag unsuspecting passerbys to a watery grave. Today, mermaids adorn walls in beach houses, table cloths and place settings, and attend children's birthday parties.  They're a staple in summertime consumer products.  Modern mermaids, it seems, have lost their edge. I look forward to working on my project and learning more about this once fearsome mythic figure.</p>

<p><i>Mermaid Map</i></p>
<p>Today, I played around in Photoshop trying to establish a style for my final project.  I hope to create an interactive map displaying mermaid lore across the world.  The map will feature small mermaid silhouettes representing mermaids specific to different regions of the globe. I think it's important that the design have a unified appearence, so at the moment I'm planning to run all of my imagery through the same "cut-out" filter in Photoshop.</p>

<hr style="height:1px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p><i>Interactive Installations</i></p>
<p>My "something cool" is a creative studio that Alec informed me of last semester called Design I/O, specializing in immersive installations for exhibitions and public spaces. Design I/O's <a href="http://design-io.com/">website</a> showcases their stunning interactive art pieces, including two that I am particularly fond of: <a href="http://design-io.com/projects/ConnectedWorlds/">Connected Worlds</a> and <a href="http://design-io.com/projects/WeatherWorlds/">Weather Worlds</a>. </p>

<p>According to Design/IO, "Connected World's is a large scale immersive, interactive ecosystem developed for the New York Hall of Science. The installation is composed of six interactive ecosystems spread out across the walls of the Great Hall, connected together by a 3000 sqft interactive floor and a 45ft high waterfall. Children can use physical logs to divert water flowing across the floor from the waterfall into the different environments, where they can then use their hands to plant seeds. As the different environments bloom, creatures appear based on the health of the environment and the type of plants growing in it." Weather Worlds is "an interactive installation that grants children weather controlling superpowers...Using their bodies children can conjure a storm, release a twisting tornado or rain down bolts of lightning from their fingertips." </p>

<p>Both installations remind me of an exhibition that was housed at the Museum of Science in the 90s when I was growing ups. Visitors would stand in front of a wall and see colorful projections of their silhouettes. There was a camera-like feature, which would cause the silhouettes to freeze at regular intervals. It was so cool! I think it's amazing how programming and physical computing have evolved to produce such striking, impactful art! </p>

<p><i>People Card</i></p>
<p>My people card for Eric has undergone several iterations.  I used a series of Photoshop filters to achieve a sketch effect for his portrait and I found some fun 70s wallpaper to serve as the background. My original idea was to have the "Woof! Woof" dialogue box appear, followed by Eric's beagle, which I'd hoped would ascend upwards within the frame.  I figured out how to make the beagle appear when the user hovers over him, which looks okay too.  Going forward, I'd like to iterate on Eric's people card and make the beagle rise after the user clicks on the card. I'd also like to incorporate a "Woof" noise and event listener.</p>

<p><i>General Reflections</i></p>
<p>Although sometimes difficult, I truly appreciate the problem-solving, project-based nature of this course. In creating Eric's people card I ran into a host of challenges trying to layer images atop one another. I've found that programming in small increments works better for me than spending several hours straight working on a project. It's helpful to address a challenge with a fresh pair of eyes.  </p>

<h4 style="color:#0a374c"> June 22: People Card Mock Ups</h4>
<p><i>Eric's People Card</i></p>
<p>It's the second day of class and I'm excited to be working on Eric's people card.  I came up with four mock ups based on his interest in scuba diving as well as his love of steak, video games, and his pet beagle. I'm getting used to using Github Desktop, Sublime Text, and Slack, and looking forward to increasing my familiarity with these tools.</p>
