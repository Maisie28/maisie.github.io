<h4 style="color:#0a374c"> June 30: Why Mermaids?</h4>
<hr style="height:1px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p><i>Modern vs. Ancient Mermaids</i></p>
<p>As a child, my favorite Disney character was the Little Mermaid-- hands down. With her bright red hair and green mermaid tail, and conflicting desire to occupy both the land and sea, I couldn't image a more compelling costume or backstory. I grew up visiting my grandparents who lived in Cape Cod, and I image my strong affinity for the Little Mermaid and the ocean began there. I loved swimming, searching for shells, and making sandcastles.  As an adult, I feel a sense of calm when I visit the ocean and I think that my fondness for mermaids lies in nostalgia for my childhood summers spent at the beach.</p>  
<p>It's interesting to me that ancient mermaids were associated with danger, vanity, and uncertainty. Across the ancient world, they were depicted as beutiful, but fearsome, likely to drag unsuspecting passerbys to a watery grave. Today, mermaids adorn walls in beach houses, table cloths and place settings, and attend children's birthday parties.  They're a staple in summertime consumer products.  Modern mermaids, it seems, have lost their edge. I look forward to working on my project and learning more about this once fearsome mythic figure.</p>

<h4 style="color:#0a374c"> June 29: Pinterest Inspiration </h4>
<hr style="height:1px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p><i>Pinning!</i></p>
<p>Pinterest is my favorite social media platform.  I love finding recipes, home decor, and design inspiration on this site.  As part of this project, I have expanded my sea-themed board to include mermaids. I've found it to be superior to a google search in terms of the quality of the imagery it brings up, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to find inspiration or refine the aesthetic of their project. </p>

<h4 style="color:#0a374c"> June 28: Reflections on Mocks Ups and Mermaid Map </h4>
<hr style="height:1px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p><i>Mermaid Map</i></p>
<p>Today, I played around in Photoshop trying to establish a style for my final project.  I hope to create an interactive map displaying mermaid lore across the world.  The map will feature small mermaid silhouettes representing mermaids specific to different regions of the globe. I think it's important that the design have a unified appearence, so at the moment I'm planning to run all of my imagery through the same "cut-out" filter in Photoshop.</p>

<h4 style="color:#0a374c"> June 27: Updates to People Card </h4>
<hr style="height:1px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p><i>Eric's People Card Plus "Woof!"</i></p>
<p>Today, I worked with Molly to enhance my people card for Eric. In the new and improved Eric card, the user clicks on the card and the "Woof" dialogue box appears and changes sizes. The dog also appears.  When the user presses a key, a "Woof" sound happens-- this is so fun! </p>

<p> In addition to working on my people card, I also brainstormed final project ideas with the people at my table.  I am excited to get started on my map representing mermaid lore.  In addition to creating the map using CSS and HTML, my hope is that I can incoporate JavaScript animations into the mermaid representations.</p>

<h4 style="color:#0a374c"> June 25: Something Cool, People Card, and Programming Reflections </h4>
<hr style="height:1px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p><i>Interactive Installations</i></p>
<p>My "something cool" is a creative studio that Alec informed me of last semester called Design I/O, specializing in immersive installations for exhibitions and public spaces. Design I/O's <a href="http://design-io.com/">website</a> showcases their stunning interactive art pieces, including two that I am particularly fond of: <a href="http://design-io.com/projects/ConnectedWorlds/">Connected Worlds</a> and <a href="http://design-io.com/projects/WeatherWorlds/">Weather Worlds</a>. </p>

<p>According to Design/IO, "Connected World's is a large scale immersive, interactive ecosystem developed for the New York Hall of Science. The installation is composed of six interactive ecosystems spread out across the walls of the Great Hall, connected together by a 3000 sqft interactive floor and a 45ft high waterfall. Children can use physical logs to divert water flowing across the floor from the waterfall into the different environments, where they can then use their hands to plant seeds. As the different environments bloom, creatures appear based on the health of the environment and the type of plants growing in it." Weather Worlds is "an interactive installation that grants children weather controlling superpowers...Using their bodies children can conjure a storm, release a twisting tornado or rain down bolts of lightning from their fingertips." </p>

<img src="http://design-io.com/projects/ConnectedWorlds/18958443432_97e0d19c9d_o_1.jpg" alt="Connected Worlds"; style="width:800px;height:500px;">

<p>Both installations remind me of an exhibition that was housed at the Museum of Science in the 90s when I was growing ups. Visitors would stand in front of a wall and see colorful projections of their silhouettes. There was a camera-like feature, which would cause the silhouettes to freeze at regular intervals. It was so cool! I think it's amazing how programming and physical computing have evolved to produce such striking, impactful art! </p>

<p><i>People Card</i></p>
<p>My people card for Eric has undergone several iterations.  I used a series of Photoshop filters to achieve a sketch effect for his portrait and I found some fun 70s wallpaper to serve as the background. My original idea was to have the "Woof! Woof" dialogue box appear, followed by Eric's beagle, which I'd hoped would ascend upwards within the frame.  I figured out how to make the beagle appear when the user hovers over him, which looks okay too.  Going forward, I'd like to iterate on Eric's people card and make the beagle rise after the user clicks on the card. I'd also like to incorporate a "Woof" noise and event listener.</p>

<p><i>General Reflections</i></p>
<p>Although sometimes difficult, I truly appreciate the problem-solving, project-based nature of this course. In creating Eric's people card I ran into a host of challenges trying to layer images atop one another. I've found that programming in small increments works better for me than spending several hours straight working on a project. It's helpful to address a challenge with a fresh pair of eyes.  </p>

<h4 style="color:#0a374c"> June 22: People Card Mock Ups</h4>
<p><i>Eric's People Card</i></p>
<p>It's the second day of class and I'm excited to be working on Eric's people card.  I came up with four mock ups based on his interest in scuba diving as well as his love of steak, video games, and his pet beagle. I'm getting used to using Github Desktop, Sublime Text, and Slack, and looking forward to increasing my familiarity with these tools.</p>
